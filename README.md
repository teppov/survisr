# survisr

**survisr** is an R pacakge for managing and visualizing tabular (*"tidy"*) survey data. The repository contains an RStudio project folder, so you should be able to download the contents, open the project (*"survisr.Rproj"*) in RStudio and build the package. Then you can import the package with `library( survisr )` and start using the functions.

Howver, the package is in a very early development phase and, at this point, intended mainly for personal use. Use with your own risk.
